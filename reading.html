    <p>The Reading section consists of 40 questions, designed to test a wide range of reading skills. These include reading for gist,
      reading for main ideas, reading for detail, skimming, understanding logical argument and recognising writers' opinions, attitudes and purpose.</p><hr>

    <h2>IELTS Reading description</h2>
    <p><span>Paper format: </span>Three reading passages with a variety of questions using a number of task types.</p>
    <p><span>Timing: </span>60 minutes</p>
    <p><span>No. of questions: </span>40</p>
    <p><span>Task types: </span>A variety of question types are used, chosen from the following; multiple choice, identifying information,
       identifying the writer’s views/claims, matching information, matching headings, matching features, matching sentence endings, sentence completion,
       summary completion, note completion, table completion, flow-chart completion, diagram label completion and short-answer questions.</p>
    <p><span>Sources: </span>Texts are taken from books, journals, magazines and newspapers, and have been written for a non-specialist audience.
      All the topics are of general interest. They deal with issues which are interesting, recognisably appropriate and accessible to test takers entering
      undergraduate or postgraduate courses or seeking professional registration. The passages may be written in a variety of styles, for example narrative,
      descriptive or discursive/argumentative. At least one text contains detailed logical argument. Texts may contain non-verbal materials such as diagrams,
      graphs or illustrations. If texts contain technical terms a simple glossary is provided.</p>
    <p><span>Answering: </span>Test takers are required to transfer their answers to an answer sheet during the time allowed for the test. No extra time is
      allowed for transfer. Care should be taken when writing answers on the answer sheet as poor spelling and grammar are penalised.</p>
    <p><span>Marks: </span>Each question is worth 1 mark.</p><hr>

    <h2>Task type 1 – Multiple choice</h2>
    <p><span>Task type and format: </span>Test takers are required to choose the best answer from four alternatives (A, B, C or D),
      or the best two answers from five alternatives (A, B, C, D or E), or the best three answers from seven alternatives (A, B, C, D, E, F or G).
      Test takers write the letter of the answer they have chosen on the answer sheet. The questions may involve completing a sentence, where they
      are given the first part of a sentence and then choose the best way to complete it from the options, or could involve complete questions; with
      the test takers choosing the option which best answers them.</p>
    <p>The questions are in the same order as the information in the text: that is, the answer to the first question in this group will be located in
      the text before the answer to the second question, and so on. This task type may be used with any type of text.</p>
    <p><span>Task focus: </span>Multiple choice tests a wide range of reading skills, including detailed understanding of specific points or an overall
      understanding of the main points of the text.</p>
    <p><span>No. of questions: </span>Variable</p><hr>

    <h2>Task type 2 – Identifying information</h2>
    <p><span>Task type and format: </span>Test takers will be given a number of statements and asked: ‘Do the following statements agree with the information
      in the text?’ They are then required to write ‘true’, ‘false’ or ‘not given’ in the boxes on their answer sheets.</p>
    <p>It is important to understand the difference between 'false' and 'not given'. 'False' means that the passage states the opposite of the statement in
      question; 'not given' means that the statement is neither confirmed nor contradicted by the information in the passage.</p>
    <p>Students need to understand that any knowledge they bring with them from outside the passage should not play a part when deciding on their answers.</p>
    <p><span>Task focus: </span>Identifying information assesses the test takers’ ability to recognise particular points of information conveyed in the text.
      It can thus be used with more factual texts.</p>
    <p><span>No. of questions: </span>Variable</p><hr>

    <h2>Task type 3 – Identifying writer’s views/claims</h2>
    <p><span>Task type and format: </span>Test takers will be given a number of statements and asked: ‘Do the following statements agree with the views/claims of
      the writer?’ They are required to write ‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘not given’ in the boxes on their answer sheet.</p>
    <p>It is important to understand the difference between 'no' and 'not given'. 'No' means that the views or claims of the writer explicitly disagree with the
      statement, i.e. the writer somewhere expresses the view or makes a claim which is opposite to the one given in the question; 'not given' means that the view
      or claim is neither confirmed nor contradicted.</p>
    <p>Students need to understand that any knowledge they bring with them from outside the passage should not play a part when deciding on their answers.</p>
    <p><span>Task focus: </span>This type of task assesses the test takers’ ability to recognise opinions or ideas, and so it is often used with discursive or
      argumentative texts.</p>
    <p><span>No. of questions: </span>Variable</p><hr>

    <h2>Task type 4 – Matching information</h2>
    <p><span>Task type and format: </span>Test takers are required to locate specific information within the lettered paragraphs/sections of a text, and to write
      the letters of the correct paragraphs/sections in the boxes on their answer sheet.</p>
    <p>They may be asked to find: specific details, an example, a reason, a description, a comparison, a summary, an explanation. They will not necessarily need to
      find information in every paragraph/section of the text, but there may be more than one piece of information that test takers need to locate in a given
      paragraph/section. When this is the case, they will be told that they can use any letter more than once.</p>
    <p>This type of task can be used with any text as it tests a wide range of reading skills, from locating detail to recognising a summary or definition.</p>
    <p><span>Task focus: </span>Matching information assesses the test takers’ ability to scan for specific information. Unlike task type 5, Matching headings, it
      is concerned with specific information rather than with the main idea.</p>
    <p><span>No. of questions: </span>Variable</p><hr>

    <h2>Task type 5 – Matching headings</h2>
    <p><span>Task type and format: </span>Test takers are given a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading
      will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Test takers must match the heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked
      alphabetically. Test takers write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be more headings than there are paragraphs
      or sections, so that some headings will not be used. It is also possible that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. One or more paragraphs
      or sections may already be matched with a heading as an example for test takers. This task type is used with texts that contain paragraphs or sections with clearly
      defined themes.</p>
    <p><span>Task focus: </span>Matching headers tests the test takers’ ability to recognise the main idea or theme in the paragraphs or sections of a text, and to distinguish
      main ideas from supporting ones.</p>
    <p><span>No. of questions: </span>Variable</p><hr>

    <h2>Task type 6 – Matching features</h2>
    <p><span>Task type and format: </span>Test takers are required to match a set of statements or pieces of information to a list of options. The options are a group of
      features from the text, and are identified by letters. Test takers may, for example, be required to match different research findings to a list of researchers, or
      characteristics to age groups, events to historical periods, etc. It is possible that some options will not be used, and that others may be used more than once.
      The instructions will inform test takers if options may be used more than once.</p>
    <p><span>Task focus: </span>Matching features assesses the test takers’ ability to recognise relationships and connections between facts in the text and their ability
      to recognise opinions and theories. It may be used both with factual information, as well as opinion-based discursive texts. Test takers need to be able to skim and
      scan the text in order to locate the required information and to read for detail.</p>
    <p><span>No. of questions: </span>Variable</p><hr>

    <h2>Task type 7 – Matching sentence endings</h2>
    <p><span>Task type and format: </span>Test takers are given the first half of a sentence based on the text and asked to choose the best way to complete it from a list
      of possible options. They will have more options to choose from than there are questions. Test takers must write the letter they have chosen on the answer sheet. The
      questions are in the same order as the information in the passage: that is, the answer to the first question in this group will be found before the answer to the second
      question, and so on. This task type may be used with any type of text.</p>
    <p><span>Task focus: </span>Matching sentence endings assesses the test takers’ ability to understand the main ideas within a sentence.</p>
    <p><span>No. of questions: </span>Variable</p><hr>
